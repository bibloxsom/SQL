-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then, I created a table to insert the Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 


-- Creating the table: 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)


-- Using SQL to analyze the data:

-- Which artists have more than one track listed in the database and how many tracks do they each have?
SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, COUNT(track_name) AS amount_of_tracks
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING amount_of_tracks > 1
ORDER BY amount_of_tracks DESC;

-- What are the top 10 most popular songs in the database?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- What are the top 10 least popular songs in the database?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity ASC
LIMIT 10;

-- What is the average tempo of the songs that have a popularity score of 90 or above?
SELECT ROUND(AVG(tempo), 2) AS avg_tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE track_name 
IN (SELECT track_name 
    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
    WHERE popularity >= 90);

-- Where do the top 5 longest songs rank in popularity?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms / 1000 AS duration_seconds, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_seconds DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Which songs include a feature of another artist?
SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE track_name LIKE '%(feat%'
OR track_name LIKE '%(with%'
ORDER BY artist_name;
